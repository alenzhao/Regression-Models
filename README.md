# Regression Models.
### They are nifty

For single feature models : 
	Implemented single feature linear regression model and single feature polynomial regression model.
	
For multi-feature models :
	Implemented multi-feature polynomial model using explicit solution.
		Iterative solution using Stochastic Gradient descent
		and solved dual problem using Gaussian Kernel Function.
